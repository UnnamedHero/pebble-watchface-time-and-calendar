Watchwace mainly designed for Pebble classic watches (I have Pebble classic). Written in C, configuration part in js.

The code is licenced under GPLv3 license. 

Main features:
- bluetooth connection status
- smartwatch battery status
- shows date and time
- shows a three-week calendar grid
- shows current weather status (OpenWeatherMap API key required)
- weather forecast
- various vibration settings
- font and background color options
- simple quiet time support for pebble classic watches (other platforms have native support I suppose)
- english and russian translations.

Configurable with Clay for Pebble framework. It means - no external website is needed to load configurartion page, all is done on your smartphone.

Feel free to post any comments on GitHub page, report bugs, ask for features.

Nearest plans:
- add more configurable options;
